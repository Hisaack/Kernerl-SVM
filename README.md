# Kernerl-SVM
SVC and NuSVC are similar methods, but accept slightly different sets of parameters and have different mathematical formulations (see section Mathematical formulation). On the other hand, LinearSVC is another implementation of Support Vector Classification for the case of a linear kernel. Note that LinearSVC does not accept keyword kernel, as this is assumed to be linear. It also lacks some of the members of SVC and NuSVC, like support_.  As other classifiers, SVC, NuSVC and LinearSVC take as input two arrays: an array X of size [n_samples, n_features] holding the training samples, and an array y of class labels (strings or integers), size
